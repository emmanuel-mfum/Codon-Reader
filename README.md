# Codon Reader
 Program dealing with codons (written in Java)

This program can be described as one big switch.

The user can input a codon ( a sequence of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that corresponds with a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis)  made of of three letters A (for adenine), G( for guanine), C(for cytosine) and U( for uracil).

The program then goes through the different existing combinations of nucleobases. It finds the corresponding anticodon which corresponds to a specific amino acid.

The name of the corresponding amino acid is then displayed along with its abbreviation.
